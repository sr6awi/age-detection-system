# 🧑‍💻 Age Estimation using Deep Learning

🚀 A complete deep learning project for **Age Estimation** built from scratch and with **Transfer Learning** on the **UTKFace dataset**.  
This was my **graduation project (2024)**, done fully independently — covering dataset preparation, training multiple CNN architectures, fine-tuning pre-trained models, and benchmarking performance with **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Age estimation is a challenging computer vision problem due to variations in lighting, ethnicity, facial features, and image quality.  
This project applies both **custom CNNs** and **transfer learning** with powerful architectures to achieve robust results.

---

## 🧠 Architectures Used
- CNN (from scratch)
- VGG16 / VGG19  
- ResNet50 / ResNet101  
- DenseNet121  
- Xception  
- MobileNet  

---

## 📊 Results
✅ Achieved a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 6.99** with **ResNet-50** (UTKFace dataset).  
This result is **competitive with or surpasses many published works** on the same dataset.
